In this project, we investigate a dataset that collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The data was originally sourced from [kaggle, posted by JONIHOPPEN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

We would like to know why patients miss their medical appointments.
